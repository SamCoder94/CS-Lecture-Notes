    " \"git add .\" adds the whole directory\n",
    " - \"git status\"\n",

    "<p>In shorthand, border properties apply in top right bottom left order</p>\n",

    "<p>HTML vs XHTML doesn't matter as long as it is strictly one or the other</p>\n",

    "<p>CSS REpositions content</p>\n",
    "<p>Float property allows later content to wrap around, but their blocks do not change shape</p>\n",
    "<p>Clear property stops floating content from covering late content</p>\n",
    "<p>None floated boxes may be turned into columns, which are fairly easy to create using floats</p>\n",
    "<p>Static - default non-positioned value\n",
    "Relative  - Element in page flow, but shown off set\n",
    "Absolute - removed from page flow and placed anywhere\n",
    "Fixed - removeed from page flow and locked to browser view port</p>\n",
    "<p>Elements acting as origins for absolute positioning must themselves have a postion</p>\n",
    "<p>Fixed positioning allows rest of content to scroll behind so is useful for nav bars</p>\n",
