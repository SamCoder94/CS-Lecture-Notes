    " - \"git add\"\n",
    " Current working file version into staging area, preparing for a commit\n",
    " \"git add .\" adds the whole directory\n",
    " - \"git status\"\n",
    " Checks what will be committed\n",
    " - \"git commit\"\n",
    " Makes commit based on currently staged files, starts an editor\n",
